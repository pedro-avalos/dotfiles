# Dotfiles

Some configuration files I use in my Linux installations.

## Installation

1. Clone repository to `~/.dotfiles`.
2. Run `~/.dotfiles/bin/install_dots.sh`.
3. If there are any errors (i.e. folders already existing, you may delete
    existing folders and re-run step 2 to ensure dotfiles are installed).

## Documentation

The following dotfiles are complex enough to warrant further documentation:

- [Qtile dotfiles readme](./config/qtile/README.md)

## Separate dotfile repositories

The following dotfiles warranted having their own repository:

- [pavalos6401/nvim](https://gitlab.com/pavalos6401/nvim)
